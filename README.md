# ENEE646-Pipeline-and-Cache-Simulator
Projects for ENEE646 Digital Computer Design course at UMD. Did all programming in C language under Linux.

### Implement an in-order MIPS interger/floating points pipeline simulator (pa1)
- Create a cycle-accurate simulator of an in-order MIPS processor that supports 32-bit integer and floating point operations
- Deal with data hazards, control hazards, and structural hazards

### Implement an out-of-order MIPS interger/floating points pipeline simulator (pa2)
- Create a cycle-accurate simulator of an out-of-order MIPS processor based on Tomasuloâ€™s Algorithm

### Implement a trace-driven cache simulator (pa3 & pa4)
- Analyzed the impact of different cache configurations (e.g. block size, cache size, associativity, write-back, write-allocate) on the cache hit rate
- Extended the program to simulate multicore cache behaviour for MESI protocol
